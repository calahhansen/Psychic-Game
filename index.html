<h2>Description: The app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose.</h2>

<h1>Guess what letter I'm thinking of....</h1>


<script>
    const compGuess = "";
    const abc = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
    const abcLength = abc.length;
    console.log(abc.length)

</script>

can use forEach??
for (let i = 0; i < abc.length; i++) {
    result += abc.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() *))
}
return result;
}
console.log()

Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

Losses: (# of times the user has guessed the correct letter)

Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)

Your Guesses so Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

When the player wins, increase the wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page)

When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh.
